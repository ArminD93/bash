   Drawing representing the Internet of things (IoT).

   The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices,
   vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics,
   software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable
   these objects to connect and exchange data.^[1]^[2]^[3] Each thing is
   uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able
   to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts
   estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by
   2020.^[4]

   The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across
   existing network infrastructure,^[5] creating opportunities for more
   direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,
   and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in
   addition to reduced human intervention.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9] When IoT is
   augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an
   instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which
   also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, virtual power
   plants, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities.

   "Things", in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices such
   as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals,
   cameras streaming live feeds of wild animals in coastal waters,^[10]
   automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for
   environmental/food/pathogen monitoring,^[11] or field operation devices
   that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations.^[12] Legal
   scholars suggest regarding "things" as an "inextricable mixture of
   hardware, software, data and service".^[13]

   These devices collect useful data with the help of various existing
   technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other
   devices.^[14]

   The term "the Internet of things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter
   & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999.^[15]

History[edit]

   As of 2016^[update], the vision of the Internet of things has evolved
   due to a convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous
   wireless communication, real-time analytics, machine learning,
   commodity sensors, and embedded systems.^[12] This means that the
   traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks,
   control systems, automation (including home and building automation),
   and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things.^[16]

   The concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as
   1982, with a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University
   becoming the first Internet-connected appliance,^[17] able to report
   its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold.^[18] Mark
   Weiser's seminal 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of
   the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and
   PerCom produced the contemporary vision of IoT.^[19]^[20] In 1994 Reza
   Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets
   of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate
   everything from home appliances to entire factories".^[21] Between 1993
   and 1996 several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft's at Work
   or Novell's NEST. However, only in 1999 did the field start gathering
   momentum. Bill Joy envisioned Device to Device (D2D) communication as
   part of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum
   at Davos in 1999.^[22]

   The concept of the Internet of things became popular in 1999, through
   the Auto-ID Center at MIT and related market-analysis
   publications.^[23] Radio-frequency identification (RFID) was seen by
   Kevin Ashton (one of the founders of the original Auto-ID Center) as a
   prerequisite for the Internet of things at that point.^[24] Ashton
   prefers the phrase "Internet for things."^[25] If all objects and
   people in daily life were equipped with identifiers, computers could
   manage and inventory them.^[26]^[27]^[28] Besides using RFID, the
   tagging of things may be achieved through such technologies as near
   field communication, barcodes, QR codes and digital
   watermarking.^[29]^[30]

   In its original interpretation,^[when?] one of the first consequences
   of implementing the Internet of things by equipping all objects in the
   world with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable
   identifiers would be to transform daily life.^[31]^[32] For instance,
   instant and ceaseless inventory control would become ubiquitous.^[32] A
   person's ability to interact with objects could be altered remotely
   based on immediate or present needs, in accordance with existing
   end-user agreements.^[24] For example, such technology could grant
   motion-picture publishers much more control over end-user private
   devices by remotely enforcing copyright restrictions and digital rights
   management, so the ability of a customer who bought a Blu-ray disc to
   watch the movie could become dependent on the copyright holder's
   decision, similar to Circuit City's failed DIVX.^[citation needed]

   A significant transformation is to extend "things" from the data
   generated from devices to objects in the physical space. The
   thought-model for future interconnection environment was proposed in
   2004.^[33] The model includes the notion of the ternary universe
   consists of the physical world, virtual world and mental world and a
   multi-level reference architecture with the nature and devices at the
   bottom level followed by the level of the Internet, sensor network, and
   mobile network, and intelligent human-machine communities at the top
   level, which supports geographically dispersed users to cooperatively
   accomplish tasks and solve problems by using the network to actively
   promote the flow of material, energy, techniques, information,
   knowledge, and services in this environment.^[34] This thought model
   envisioned the development trend of the Internet of things.

Applications[edit]

   The applications for internet connected devices are extensive. Multiple
   categorizations have been suggested, most of which agree on a
   separation between consumer, enterprise (business), and infrastructure
   applications.^[35]^[36] George Osborne, the former British Chancellor
   of the Exchequer, posited that the Internet of things is the next stage
   of the information revolution and referenced the inter-connectivity of
   everything from urban transport to medical devices to household
   appliances.^[37]

   The ability to network embedded devices with limited CPU, memory and
   power resources means that IoT finds applications in nearly every
   field.^[38] Such systems could be in charge of collecting information
   in settings ranging from natural ecosystems to buildings and
   factories,^[39] thereby finding applications in fields of environmental
   sensing and urban planning.^[40]

   Intelligent shopping systems, for example, could monitor specific
   users' purchasing habits in a store by tracking their specific mobile
   phones. These users could then be provided with special offers on their
   favorite products, or even location of items that they need, which
   their fridge has automatically conveyed to the phone.^[41]^[42]
   Additional examples of sensing and actuating are reflected in
   applications that deal with heat, water, electricity and energy
   management, as well as cruise-assisting transportation
   systems.^[43]^[44]^[45] Other applications that the Internet of things
   can provide is enabling extended home security features and home
   automation.^[46] The concept of an "Internet of living things" has been
   proposed to describe networks of biological sensors that could use
   cloud-based analyses to allow users to study DNA or other
   molecules.^[47]^[48]

Consumer application[edit]

   A growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use. Examples
   of consumer applications include connected car, entertainment, home
   automation (also known as smart home devices), wearable technology,
   quantified self, connected health, and appliances such as
   washer/dryers, robotic vacuums, air purifiers, ovens, or
   refrigerators/freezers that use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.^[49]
   Consumer IoT provides new opportunities for user experience and
   interfaces.^[citation needed]

   Some consumer applications have been criticized for their lack of
   redundancy and their inconsistency, leading to a popular parody known
   as the “Internet of Shit.”^[50] Companies have been criticized for
   their rush into IoT, creating devices of questionable value,^[51] and
   not setting up stringent security standards.^[52]

Smart Home[edit]

   IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, also
   known as domotics. Large smart home systems utilize a main hub or
   controller to provide users with a central control for all of their
   devices. These devices can include lighting, heating and air
   conditioning, media and security systems.^[53] Ease of usability is the
   most immediate benefit to connecting these functionalities. Long term
   benefits can include the ability to create a more environmentally
   friendly home by automating some functions such as ensuring lights and
   electronics are turned off. One of the major obstacles to obtaining
   smart home technology is the high initial cost. ^[54]

Applications[edit]

   One application of smart home is to provide assistance for disabled and
   elderly individuals. These home systems utilize assistive technology to
   accommodate an owner's specific disabilities.^[55] Voice control can
   assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems
   can be connected directly to Cochlear implants worn by hearing impaired
   users.^[56] They can also be equipped with additional safety features.
   These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies
   such as falls or seizures.^[57] Smart home technology applied in this
   way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of
   life.^[58]

   A second application of smart home is even more sophisticated. One can
   guide his or her connected device at home even from far away. If one
   for example leaves the office, it is possible to tell a connected air
   conditioner device via smart phone to cool down the house to a certain
   temperature.

   Another example would be to use smart devices as for examples Amazon`s
   Alexa to get the most recent and most important news of the day while
   cutting the vegetables for the meal you are cooking at the moment. In
   general, Smart Home devices make life easier at home and give us the
   possibility to make several things at the same time. ^[59]

Enterprise[edit]

   The term "Enterprise IoT," or EIoT, is used to refer to all devices
   used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is estimated the
   EIoT will account for nearly 40% or 9.1 billion devices.^[35]

Media[edit]

   Media uses of the internet of things is primarily concerned with
   marketing to and studying consumer habits. Through behavioral targeting
   these devices collect many actionable points of information about
   millions of individuals.^[60] Using the profiles built during the
   targeting process, media producers present display advertising in line
   with the consumers known habits at a time and location to maximize its
   effect.^[61] ^[62] Further information is collected by tracking how
   consumers interact with the content. This is done through conversion
   tracking, drop off rate, click through rate registration rate and
   interaction rate. The size of the data often presents challenges as it
   crosses into the realm of big data. However, benefits gained from the
   data stored greatly out weighs these challenges.^[63] ^[64]

Infrastructure Management[edit]

   Monitoring and controlling operations of urban and rural
   infrastructures like bridges, railway tracks, on- and offshore-
   wind-farms is a key application of the IoT.^[65] The IoT infrastructure
   can be used for monitoring any events or changes in structural
   conditions that can compromise safety and increase risk. It can also be
   used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an efficient
   manner, by coordinating tasks between different service providers and
   users of these facilities.^[39] IoT devices can also be used to control
   critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships. Usage
   of IoT devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to
   improve incident management and emergency response coordination, and
   quality of service, up-times and reduce costs of operation in all
   infrastructure related areas.^[66] Even areas such as waste management
   can benefit ^[67] from automation and optimization that could be
   brought in by the IoT.^[68]

Manufacturing[edit]

   Network control and management of manufacturing equipment, asset and
   situation management, or manufacturing process control bring the IoT
   within the realm of industrial applications and smart manufacturing as
   well.^[69] The IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing of
   new products, dynamic response to product demands, and real-time
   optimization of manufacturing production and supply chain networks, by
   networking machinery, sensors and control systems together.^[39]

   Digital control systems to automate process controls, operator tools
   and service information systems to optimize plant safety and security
   are within the purview of the IoT.^[65] But it also extends itself to
   asset management via predictive maintenance, statistical evaluation,
   and measurements to maximize reliability.^[70] Smart industrial
   management systems can also be integrated with the Smart Grid, thereby
   enabling real-time energy optimization. Measurements, automated
   controls, plant optimization, health and safety management, and other
   functions are provided by a large number of networked sensors.^[39]

   The term industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is often encountered in
   the manufacturing industries, referring to the industrial subset of the
   IoT. IIoT in manufacturing could generate so much business value that
   it will eventually lead to the fourth industrial revolution, so the
   so-called Industry 4.0. It is estimated that in the future, successful
   companies will be able to increase their revenue through Internet of
   things by creating new business models and improve productivity,
   exploit analytics for innovation, and transform workforce.^[71] The
   potential of growth by implementing IIoT will generate $12 trillion of
   global GDP by 2030.^[71]
   Design architecture of cyber-physical systems-enabled manufacturing
   system^[72]

   While connectivity and data acquisition are imperative for IIoT, they
   should not be the purpose, rather the foundation and path to something
   bigger. Among all the technologies, predictive maintenance is probably
   a relatively "easier win" since it is applicable to existing assets and
   management systems. The objective of intelligent maintenance systems is
   to reduce unexpected downtime and increase productivity. And to realize
   that alone would generate around up to 30% over the total maintenance
   costs.^[71] Industrial big data analytics will play a vital role in
   manufacturing asset predictive maintenance, although that is not the
   only capability of industrial big data.^[73]^[74] Cyber-physical
   systems (CPS) is the core technology of industrial big data and it will
   be an interface between human and the cyber world. Cyber-physical
   systems can be designed by following the 5C (connection, conversion,
   cyber, cognition, configuration) architecture,^[72] and it will
   transform the collected data into actionable information, and
   eventually interfere with the physical assets to optimize
   processes.^[citation needed]

   An IoT-enabled intelligent system of such cases was proposed in 2001
   and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation
   Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent
   Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on a band saw
   machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago.^[75]^[76]^[77] Band saw machines are
   not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous
   since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and
   intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the
   band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system
   will be able to recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts
   even if the condition is changing, advising users when is the best time
   to replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience
   and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.^[77]

Agriculture[edit]

   The IoT contributes significantly towards innovating farming
   methods.[1] Farming challenges caused by population growth and climate
   change have made it one of the first industries to utilize the IoT. The
   integration of wireless sensors with agricultural mobile apps and cloud
   platforms helps in collecting vital information pertaining to the
   environmental conditions^[78] – temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind
   speed, pest infestation, soil humus content or nutrients, besides
   others – linked with a farmland, can be used to improve and automate
   farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and
   quantity, and minimize risks and wastes. The app-based field or crop
   monitoring also lowers the hassles of managing crops at multiple
   locations. For example, farmers can now detect which areas have been
   fertilised (or mistakenly missed), if the land is too dry and predict
   future yields.

Energy management[edit]

   Integration of sensing and actuation systems, connected to the
   Internet, is likely to optimize energy consumption as a whole.^[39] It
   is expected that IoT devices will be integrated into all forms of
   energy consuming devices (switches, power outlets, bulbs, televisions,
   etc.) and be able to communicate with the utility supply company in
   order to effectively balance power generation and energy usage.^[79]
   Such devices would also offer the opportunity for users to remotely
   control their devices, or centrally manage them via a cloud-based
   interface, and enable advanced functions like scheduling (e.g.,
   remotely powering on or off heating systems, controlling ovens,
   changing lighting conditions etc.).^[39]

   Besides home-based energy management, the IoT is especially relevant to
   the Smart Grid since it provides systems to gather and act on energy
   and power-related information in an automated fashion with the goal to
   improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of
   the production and distribution of electricity.^[79] Using advanced
   metering infrastructure (AMI) devices connected to the Internet
   backbone, electric utilities can not only collect data from end-user
   connections but also, manage other distribution automation devices like
   transformers and reclosers.^[39]

Environmental monitoring[edit]

   Environmental monitoring applications of the IoT typically use sensors
   to assist in environmental protection^[80] by monitoring air or water
   quality,^[10] atmospheric or soil conditions,^[81] and can even include
   areas like monitoring the movements of wildlife and their
   habitats.^[82] Development of resource-constrained devices connected to
   the Internet also means that other applications like earthquake or
   tsunami early-warning systems can also be used by emergency services to
   provide more effective aid. IoT devices in this application typically
   span a large geographic area and can also be mobile.^[39] It has been
   argued that the standardization IoT brings to wireless sensing will
   revolutionize this area.^[83]

Building and home automation[edit]

   IoT devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical,
   electrical and electronic systems used in various types of buildings
   (e.g., public and private, industrial, institutions, or
   residential)^[39] in home automation and building automation systems.
   In this context, three main areas are being covered in literature:^[84]
     * The integration of the internet with building energy management
       systems in order to create energy efficient and IOT driven “smart
       buildings”.^[84]
     * The possible means of real-time monitoring for reducing energy
       consumption^[85] and monitoring occupant behaviors.^[84]
     * The integration of smart devices in the built environment and how
       they might be used in future applications.^[84]

Metropolitan scale deployments[edit]

   There are several planned or ongoing large-scale deployments of the
   IoT, to enable better management of cities and systems. For example,
   Songdo, South Korea, the first of its kind fully equipped and wired
   smart city, is on near completion. Nearly everything in this city is
   planned to be wired, connected and turned into a constant stream of
   data that would be monitored and analyzed by an array of computers with
   little, or no human intervention.^[citation needed]

   Another application is a currently undergoing project in Santander,
   Spain. For this deployment, two approaches have been adopted. This city
   of 180,000 inhabitants, has already seen 18,000 city application
   downloads for their smartphones. This application is connected to
   10,000 sensors that enable services like parking search, environmental
   monitoring, digital city agenda among others. City context information
   is used in this deployment so as to benefit merchants through a spark
   deals mechanism based on city behavior that aims at maximizing the
   impact of each notification.^[86]

   Other examples of large-scale deployments underway include the
   Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City;^[87] work on improving air and
   water quality, reducing noise pollution, and increasing transportation
   efficiency in San Jose, California;^[88] and smart traffic management
   in western Singapore.^[89] French company, Sigfox, commenced building
   an ultra-narrowband wireless data network in the San Francisco Bay Area
   in 2014, the first business to achieve such a deployment in the
   U.S.^[90]^[91] It subsequently announced it would set up a total of
   4000 base stations to cover a total of 30 cities in the U.S. by the end
   of 2016, making it the largest IoT network coverage provider in the
   country thus far.^[92]^[93]

   Another example of a large deployment is the one completed by New York
   Waterways in New York City to connect all the city's vessels and be
   able to monitor them live 24/7. The network was designed and engineered
   by Fluidmesh Networks, a Chicago-based company developing wireless
   networks for critical applications. The NYWW network is currently
   providing coverage on the Hudson River, East River, and Upper New York
   Bay. With the wireless network in place, NY Waterway is able to take
   control of its fleet and passengers in a way that was not previously
   possible. New applications can include security, energy and fleet
   management, digital signage, public Wi-Fi, paperless ticketing and
   others.^[94]

Other Fields of Application[edit]

Medical and healthcare[edit]

   IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and
   emergency notification systems. These health monitoring devices can
   range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices
   capable of monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit
   electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing aids.^[39] Some hospitals
   have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are
   occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust
   itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support is applied to the
   patient without the manual interaction of nurses.^[95]

   Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to
   monitor the health and general well-being of senior citizens, while
   also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting
   people regain lost mobility via therapy as well.^[96] Other consumer
   devices to encourage healthy living, such as, connected scales or
   wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the IoT.^[97] More
   and more end-to-end health monitoring IoT platforms are coming up for
   antenatal and chronic patients, helping one manage health vitals and
   recurring medication requirements.^[citation needed]

   The Research & Development Corporation (DEKA), a company that creates
   prosthetic limbs, has created a battery-powered arm that uses
   myoelectricity, a device that converts muscle group sensations into
   motor control. The arm is nicked named Luke Arm after Luke Skywalker
   (Star Wars).^[98]

Transportation[edit]

   Digital variable speed-limit sign.

   The IoT can assist in the integration of communications, control, and
   information processing across various transportation systems.
   Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems
   (i.e. the vehicle, the infrastructure, and the driver or user). Dynamic
   interaction between these components of a transport system enables
   inter and intra vehicular communication, smart traffic control, smart
   parking, electronic toll collection systems, logistic and fleet
   management, vehicle control, and safety and road assistance.^[39]^[99]
   In Logistics and Fleet Management for example, The IoT platform can
   continuously monitor the location and conditions of cargo and assets
   via wireless sensors and send specific alerts when management
   exceptions occur (delays, damages, thefts, etc.).

Trends and characteristics[edit]

   Technology roadmap: Internet of things.

   The IoT's major significant trend in recent years is the explosive
   growth of devices connected and controlled by the internet. ^[100] The
   wide range of applications for IoT technology mean that the specifics
   can be very different from one device to the next but there are basic
   characteristics shared by most.

Intelligence[edit]

   Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the
   original concept of the Internet of things. Ambient intelligence and
   autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures,
   either. However, there is a shift in research to integrate the concepts
   of the Internet of things and autonomous control, with initial outcomes
   towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for
   autonomous IoT.^[citation needed]

   In the future, the Internet of things may be a non-deterministic and
   open network in which auto-organized or intelligent entities (Web
   services, SOA components), virtual objects (avatars) will be
   interoperable and able to act independently (pursuing their own
   objectives or shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or
   environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning
   of context information as well as the objects ability to detect changes
   in the environment, faults affecting sensors and introduce suitable
   mitigation measures constitute a major research trend,^[101] clearly
   needed to provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT
   products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different
   technologies to support such context-aware automation but more
   sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor
   units to be deployed in real environments.^[citation needed]

Architecture[edit]

   The system will likely be an example of event-driven
   architecture,^[102] bottom-up made (based on the context of processes
   and operations, in real-time) and will consider any subsidiary level.
   Therefore, model driven and functional approaches will coexist with new
   ones able to treat exceptions and unusual evolution of processes
   (multi-agent systems, B-ADSc, etc.).^[citation needed]

   In an Internet of Things, the meaning of an event will not necessarily
   be based on a deterministic or syntactic model but would instead be
   based on the context of the event itself: this will also be a semantic
   web.^[103] Consequently, it will not necessarily need common standards
   that would not be able to address every context or use: some actors
   (services, components, avatars) will accordingly be self-referenced
   and, if ever needed, adaptive to existing common standards (predicting
   everything would be no more than defining a "global finality" for
   everything that is just not possible with any of the current top-down
   approaches and standardizations).^[citation needed]

   Building on top of the Internet of things, the web of things is an
   architecture for the application layer of the Internet of things
   looking at the convergence of data from IoT devices into Web
   applications to create innovative use-cases. In order to program and
   control the flow of information in the Internet of things, a predicted
   architectural direction is being called BPM Everywhere which is a
   blending of traditional process management with process mining and
   special capabilities to automate the control of large numbers of
   coordinated devices.^[citation needed]

Network architecture[edit]

   ^[104]

   The Internet of things requires huge scalability in the network space
   to handle the surge of devices. IETF 6LoWPAN would be used to connect
   devices to IP networks. With billions of devices^[105] being added to
   the Internet space, IPv6 will play a major role in handling the network
   layer scalability. IETF's Constrained Application Protocol, ZeroMQ, and
   MQTT would provide lightweight data transport. "MQ" in "MQTT" came from
   IBM's MQ Series message queuing product line.^[citation needed]

   Fog computing is a viable alternative to prevent such large burst of
   data flow through Internet.^[106] The edge devices' computation power
   can be used to analyse and process data, thus providing easy real time
   scalability.^[citation needed]

Complexity[edit]

   In semi-open or closed loops (i.e. value chains, whenever a global
   finality can be settled) IoT will often be considered and studied as a
   complex system^[107] due to the huge number of different links,
   interactions between autonomous actors, and its capacity to integrate
   new actors. At the overall stage (full open loop) it will likely be
   seen as a chaotic environment (since systems always have finality). As
   a practical approach, not all elements in the Internet of things run in
   a global, public space. Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate
   the risks of privacy, control and reliability. For example, Domestic
   Robotics (Domotics) running inside a smart home might only share data
   within and be available via a local network.^[citation needed]

Size considerations[edit]

   The Internet of things would encode 50 to 100 trillion objects, and be
   able to follow the movement of those objects. Human beings in surveyed
   urban environments are each surrounded by 1000 to 5000 trackable
   objects.^[108] In 2015 there were already 83 million smart devices in
   people`s homes. This number is about to grow up to 193 million devices
   in 2020 and will for sure go on growing in the near future. ^[109]

Space considerations[edit]

   In the Internet of things, the precise geographic location of a
   thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be
   critical.^[110] Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in
   time and space, have been less critical to track because the person
   processing the information can decide whether or not that information
   was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing
   information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things
   in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is
   usually important.^[111]) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising
   applications that become possible when things can become organized and
   connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the
   constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive
   amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor
   operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take
   actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is
   eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for
   granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem.
   Just as standards play a key role in the Internet and the Web,
   geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of
   things.^[citation needed]

A Solution to "basket of remotes"[edit]

   Many IoT devices have a potential to take a piece of this market.
   Jean-Louis Gassée (Apple initial alumni team, and BeOS co-founder) has
   addressed this topic in an article on Monday Note,^[112] where he
   predicts that the most likely problem will be what he calls the "basket
   of remotes" problem, where we'll have hundreds of applications to
   interface with hundreds of devices that don't share protocols for
   speaking with one another.^[citation needed]

   There are multiple approaches to solve this problem, one of them called
   the "predictive interaction",^[113] where cloud or fog based decision
   makers^[clarification needed] will predict the user's next action and
   trigger some reaction.^[citation needed]

   For user interaction, new technology leaders are joining forces to
   create standards for communication between devices. Manufacturers are
   becoming more conscious of this problem, and many companies have begun
   releasing their devices with open APIs. Many of these APIs are used by
   smaller companies looking to take advantage of quick
   integration.^[citation needed]

Frameworks[edit]

   IoT frameworks might help support the interaction between "things" and
   allow for more complex structures like distributed computing and the
   development of distributed applications. Currently, some IoT frameworks
   seem to focus on real-time data logging solutions, offering some basis
   to work with many "things" and have them interact. Future developments
   might lead to specific software-development environments to create the
   software to work with the hardware used in the Internet of things.
   Companies are developing technology platforms to provide this type of
   functionality for the Internet of things. Newer platforms are being
   developed, which add more intelligence.

   REST is a scalable architecture that allows things to communicate over
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is easily adopted for IoT applications
   to provide communication from a thing to a central web
   server.^[citation needed]

Enabling technologies for IoT[edit]

   There are many technologies that enable IoT. Crucial to the field is
   the network used to communicate between devices of an IoT installation,
   a role that several wireless or wired technologies may
   fulfill:^[114]^[115]^[116]^[117]

Addressability[edit]

   The original idea of the Auto-ID Center is based on RFID-tags and
   unique identification through the Electronic Product Code, however,
   this has evolved into objects having an IP address or URI.^[citation
   needed] An alternative view, from the world of the Semantic Web^[118]
   focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart,
   or RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as
   URI. The objects themselves do not converse, but they may now be
   referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers
   acting for their human owners.^[citation needed]Integration with the
   Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique
   identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for
   4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the
   next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the
   extremely large address space required.^[119]^[120]^[121]
   Internet-of-things devices additionally will benefit from the stateless
   address auto-configuration present in IPv6,^[122] as it reduces the
   configuration overhead on the hosts,^[120] and the IETF 6LoWPAN header
   compression. To a large extent, the future of the Internet of things
   will not be possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently, the
   global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the
   successful development of the IoT in the future.^[121]

Simulation[edit]

   IoT modeling and simulation (and emulation) is typically carried out at
   the design stage before deployment of the network. Network simulators
   like OPNET, NetSim and NS2 can be used to simulate IoT
   networks^[citation needed]. Digital Twins may also be implemented to
   produce updates on the status and health of an asset, based upon sensor
   readings integrated with a computational model of the asset.^[123]

Politics and civic engagement[edit]

   Some scholars and activists argue that the IoT can be used to create
   new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user
   control and inter-operable platforms. Philip N. Howard, a professor and
   author, writes that political life in both democracies and
   authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used
   for civic engagement. For that to happen, he argues that any connected
   device should be able to divulge a list of the "ultimate beneficiaries"
   of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add
   new organizations to the beneficiary list. In addition, he argues that
   civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for
   making use of data and engaging with the public.^[124]

Government regulation on IoT[edit]

   One of the key drivers of the IoT is data. The success of the idea of
   connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access
   to and storage & processing of data. For this purpose, companies
   working on IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their
   cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open
   for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of
   multiple systems.^[125] The other issues pertain to consumer choice and
   ownership of data^[126] and how it is used. Presently the regulators
   have shown more interest in protecting the first three issues
   identified above.^[citation needed]

   Current regulatory environment:

   A report published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in January
   2015 made the following three recommendations:^[127]
     * Data security – At the time of designing IoT companies should
       ensure that data collection, storage and processing would be secure
       at all times. Companies should adopt a “defence in depth” approach
       and encrypt data at each stage.^[128]
     * Data consent – users should have a choice as to what data they
       share with IoT companies and the users must be informed if their
       data gets exposed.
     * Data minimization – IoT companies should collect only the data they
       need and retain the collected information only for a limited time.

   However, the FTC stopped at just making recommendations for now.
   According to an FTC analysis, the existing framework, consisting of the
   FTC Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Children’s Online
   Privacy Protection Act, along with developing consumer education and
   business guidance, participation in multi-stakeholder efforts and
   advocacy to other agencies at the federal, state and local level, is
   sufficient to protect consumer rights.^[129]

   A resolution passed by the Senate in March 2015, is already being
   considered by the Congress.^[130] This resolution recognized the need
   for formulating a National Policy on IoT and the matter of privacy,
   security and spectrum. Furthermore, to provide an impetus to the IoT
   ecosystem, in March 2016, a bipartisan group of four Senators proposed
   a bill, The Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things
   (DIGIT) Act, to direct the Federal Communications Commission to assess
   the need for more spectrum to connect IoT devices.

   Several standards for the IoT industry are actually being established
   relating to automobiles because most concerns arising from use of
   connected cars apply to healthcare devices as well. In fact, the
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is preparing
   cybersecurity guidelines and a database of best practices to make
   automotive computer systems more secure.^[131]

Criticism and controversies[edit]

Platform fragmentation[edit]

   IoT suffers from platform fragmentation and lack of technical
   standards^[132]^[133]^[134]^[135]^[136]^[137]^[138] a situation where
   the variety of IoT devices, in terms of both hardware variations and
   differences in the software running on them, makes the task of
   developing applications that work consistently between different
   inconsistent technology ecosystems hard.^[1] Customers may be hesitant
   to bet their IoT future on a proprietary software or hardware devices
   that uses proprietary protocols that may fade or become difficult to
   customize and interconnect.^[2]

   IoT's amorphous computing nature is also a problem for security, since
   patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach
   users of older and lower-price devices.^[139]^[140]^[141] One set of
   researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices
   with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices
   vulnerable.^[142]^[143]

Privacy, autonomy, and control[edit]

   Philip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that the Internet of
   things offers immense potential for empowering citizens, making
   government transparent, and broadening information access. Howard
   cautions, however, that privacy threats are enormous, as is the
   potential for social control and political manipulation.^[144]

   Concerns about privacy have led many to consider the possibility that
   big data infrastructures such as the Internet of things and data mining
   are inherently incompatible with privacy.^[145] Writer Adam Greenfield
   claims that these technologies are not only an invasion of public space
   but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior, citing an
   instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the
   demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement.^[146]

   The Internet of Things Council compared the increased prevalence of
   digital surveillance due to the Internet of things to the conceptual
   panopticon described by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th Century.^[147] The
   assertion was defended by the works of French philosophers Michel
   Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the
   Prison Foucault asserts that the panopticon was a central element of
   the discipline society developed during the Industrial Era.^[148]
   Foucault also argued that the discipline systems established in
   factories and school reflected Bentham's vision of panopticism.^[148]
   In his 1992 paper "Postscripts on the Societies of Control," Deleuze
   wrote that the discipline society had transitioned into a control
   society, with the computer replacing the panopticon as an instrument of
   discipline and control while still maintaining the qualities similar to
   that of panopticism.^[149]

   The privacy of households could be compromised by solely analyzing
   smart home network traffic patterns without dissecting the contents of
   encrypted application data, yet a synthetic packet injection scheme can
   be used to safely overcome such invasion of privacy.^[150]

   Peter-Paul Verbeek, a professor of philosophy of technology at the
   University of Twente, Netherlands, writes that technology already
   influences our moral decision making, which in turn affects human
   agency, privacy and autonomy. He cautions against viewing technology
   merely as a human tool and advocates instead to consider it as an
   active agent.^[151]

   Justin Brookman, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, expressed
   concern regarding the impact of IoT on consumer privacy, saying that
   "There are some people in the commercial space who say, 'Oh, big data —
   well, let's collect everything, keep it around forever, we'll pay for
   somebody to think about security later.' The question is whether we
   want to have some sort of policy framework in place to limit
   that."^[152]

   Tim O'Reilly believes that the way companies sell the IoT devices on
   consumers are misplaced, disputing the notion that the IoT is about
   gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online and
   postulating that "IoT is really about human augmentation. The
   applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data
   driving the decision-making."^[153]

   Editorials at WIRED have also expressed concern, one stating "What
   you're about to lose is your privacy. Actually, it's worse than that.
   You aren't just going to lose your privacy, you're going to have to
   watch the very concept of privacy be rewritten under your nose."^[154]

   The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) expressed concern regarding
   the ability of IoT to erode people's control over their own lives. The
   ACLU wrote that "There's simply no way to forecast how these immense
   powers – disproportionately accumulating in the hands of corporations
   seeking financial advantage and governments craving ever more control –
   will be used. Chances are big data and the Internet of things will make
   it harder for us to control our own lives, as we grow increasingly
   transparent to powerful corporations and government institutions that
   are becoming more opaque to us."^[155]

   In response to rising concerns about privacy and smart technology, in
   2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by
   Design principles when implementing their smart metering program. The
   program would lead to replacement of traditional power meters with
   smart power meters, which could track and manage energy usage more
   accurately.^[156] However the British Computer Society is doubtful
   these principles were ever actually implemented.^[157] In 2009 the
   Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing
   their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and
   passed in 2011.^[157]

Data storage and analytics[edit]

   A challenge for producers of IoT applications is to clean, process and
   interpret the vast amount of data which is gathered by the sensors.
   There is a solution proposed for the analytics of the information
   referred to as Wireless Sensor Networks.^[158] These networks share
   data among sensor nodes that are sent to a distributed system for the
   analytics of the sensory data.^[citation needed]

   Another challenge is the storage of this bulk data. Depending on the
   application there could be high data acquisition requirements which in
   turn lead to high storage requirements. Currently the internet is
   already responsible for 5% of the total energy generated^[158] and this
   consumption will increase significantly when we start utilizing
   applications with multiple embedded sensors.^[citation needed]

Security[edit]

   Concerns have been raised that the Internet of things is being
   developed rapidly without appropriate consideration of the profound
   security challenges involved^[159] and the regulatory changes that
   might be necessary.^[160]^[161]

   Most of the technical security issues are similar to those of
   conventional servers, workstations and smartphones, but the firewall,
   security update and anti-malware systems used for those are generally
   unsuitable for the much smaller, less capable, IoT devices.^[citation
   needed]

   According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey conducted in the
   last quarter of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the
   biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology.^[162] In
   particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are
   likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual)
   threat.^[163] In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security
   columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances
   that can already "spy on people in their own homes" including
   televisions, kitchen appliances,^[164] cameras, and thermostats.^[165]
   Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine,
   locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been
   shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board
   network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are
   Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely.^[166] By
   2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control
   pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control
   of insulin pumps^[167] and implantable cardioverter
   defibrillators.^[168] David Pogue wrote^[169] that some recently
   published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions
   of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because
   of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the
   hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the
   hack required security researchers having physical access to the car
   prior to the hack to prepare for it.^[citation needed]

   The U.S. National Intelligence Council in an unclassified report
   maintains that it would be hard to deny "access to networks of sensors
   and remotely-controlled objects by enemies of the United States,
   criminals, and mischief makers... An open market for aggregated sensor
   data could serve the interests of commerce and security no less than it
   helps criminals and spies identify vulnerable targets. Thus, massively
   parallel sensor fusion may undermine social cohesion, if it proves to
   be fundamentally incompatible with Fourth-Amendment guarantees against
   unreasonable search."^[170] In general, the intelligence community
   views the Internet of things as a rich source of data.^[171]

   As a response to increasing concerns over security, the Internet of
   Things Security Foundation (IoTSF) was launched on 23 September 2015.
   IoTSF has a mission to secure the Internet of things by promoting
   knowledge and best practice. Its founding board is made from technology
   providers and telecommunications companies including BT, Vodafone,
   Imagination Technologies and Pen Test Partners. In addition, large IT
   companies are continuously developing innovative solutions to ensure
   the security for IoT devices. As per the estimates from KBV
   Research,^[172] the overall IoT security market^[173] would grow at
   27.9% rate during 2016–2022 as a result of growing infrastructural
   concerns and diversified usage of Internet of things.^[174]^[175]

   In 2016, a distributed denial of service attack powered by Internet of
   things devices running the Mirai malware took down a DNS provider and
   major web sites.^[176]

   Security experts view Internet of things as a threat to the traditional
   Internet.^[177] Some argue that market incentive to secure IoT devices
   is insufficient and increased governmental regulation is necessary to
   make the Internet of things secure.^[178]

   The overall understanding of IoT is essential for basic user security.
   Keeping up with current anti virus software and patching updates will
   help mitigate cyber attacks.

Design[edit]

   Given widespread recognition of the evolving nature of the design and
   management of the Internet of things, sustainable and secure deployment
   of IoT solutions must design for "anarchic scalability."^[179]
   Application of the concept of anarchic scalability can be extended to
   physical systems (i.e. controlled real-world objects), by virtue of
   those systems being designed to account for uncertain management
   futures. This "hard anarchic scalability" thus provides a pathway
   forward to fully realize the potential of Internet-of-things solutions
   by selectively constraining physical systems to allow for all
   management regimes without risking physical failure.^[citation needed]

   Brown University computer scientist Michael Littman has argued that
   successful execution of the Internet of things requires consideration
   of the interface's usability as well as the technology itself. These
   interfaces need to be not only more user-friendly but also better
   integrated: "If users need to learn different interfaces for their
   vacuums, their locks, their sprinklers, their lights, and their
   coffeemakers, it's tough to say that their lives have been made any
   easier."^[180]

Environmental sustainability impact[edit]

   A concern regarding Internet-of-things technologies pertains to the
   environmental impacts of the manufacture, use, and eventual disposal of
   all these semiconductor-rich devices.^[181] Modern electronics are
   replete with a wide variety of heavy metals and rare-earth metals, as
   well as highly toxic synthetic chemicals. This makes them extremely
   difficult to properly recycle. Electronic components are often
   incinerated or placed in regular landfills. Furthermore, the human and
   environmental cost of mining the rare-earth metals that are integral to
   modern electronic components continues to grow. With production of
   electronic equipment growing globally yet little of the metals (from
   end-of-life equipment) are being recovered for reuse, the environmental
   impacts can be expected to increase.^[citation needed]

   Also, because the concept of Internet of things entails adding
   electronics to mundane devices (for example, simple light switches),
   and because the major driver for replacement of electronic components
   is often technological obsolescence rather than actual failure to
   function, it is reasonable to expect that items that previously were
   kept in service for many decades would see an accelerated replacement
   cycle if they were part of the IoT. For example, a traditional house
   built with 30 light switches and 30 electrical outlets might stand for
   50 years, with all those components still original at the end of that
   period. But a modern house built with the same number of switches and
   outlets set up for IoT might see each switch and outlet replaced at
   five-year intervals, in order to keep up to date with technological
   changes. This translates into a ten-fold increase in waste requiring
   disposal.^[citation needed]

Intentional obsolescence of devices[edit]

   The Electronic Frontier Foundation has raised concerns that companies
   can use the technologies necessary to support connected devices to
   intentionally disable or "brick" their customers' devices via a remote
   software update or by disabling a service necessary to the operation of
   the device. In one example, home automation devices sold with the
   promise of a "Lifetime Subscription" were rendered useless after Nest
   Labs acquired Revolv and made the decision to shut down the central
   servers the Revolv devices had used to operate.^[182] As Nest is a
   company owned by Alphabet (Google's parent company), the EFF argues
   this sets a "terrible precedent for a company with ambitions to sell
   self-driving cars, medical devices, and other high-end gadgets that may
   be essential to a person's livelihood or physical safety."^[183]

   Owners should be free to point their devices to a different server or
   collaborate on improved software. But such action violates the United
   States DMCA section 1201, which only has an exemption for "local use".
   This forces tinkerers who want to keep using their own equipment into a
   legal grey area. EFF thinks buyers should refuse electronics and
   software that prioritize the manufacturer's wishes above their
   own.^[183]

   Examples of post-sale manipulations include Google Nest Revolv,
   disabled privacy settings on Android, Sony disabling Linux on
   PlayStation 3, enforced EULA on Wii U.^[183]

Confusing terminology[edit]

   Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has
   referred to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”.^[184] The
   lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of
   view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”.^[184] A company
   operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to
   sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics.^[184]
   According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones,
   tablets, and devices as we know them today existed, and there is a long
   list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological
   convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE),
   industrial Internet, pervasive computing, pervasive sensing, ubiquitous
   computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks
   (WSN), smart objects, cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M),
   ambient intelligence (AmI), operational technology (OT), and
   information technology (IT).^[184] Regarding IIoT, an industrial
   sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task
   Group has created a "common and reusable vocabulary of terms"^[185] to
   ensure "consistent terminology"^[185]^[186] across publications issued
   by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms
   Database including a New Term Alert^[187] to be notified when a new
   term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711
   IoT-related terms,^[188] however, without any attempts to reduce
   terminological ambiguity and complexity.^[citation needed]

IoT adoption barriers[edit]

   GE Digital CEO William Ruh speaking about GE's attempts to gain a
   foothold in the market for IoT services at the first IEEE Computer
   Society TechIgnite conference.

Lack of interoperability and unclear value propositions[edit]

   Despite a shared belief in the potential of IoT, industry leaders and
   consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike
   Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack
   interoperability or a clear use case for end-users.^[189]

     “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to
     serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people
     struggle with every day.”^[189]

   Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters,
   yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives.

     “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter
     set, we need to stop making toys no one cares about and instead work
     on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real
     people.”^[189]

   A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish
   companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly
   where the value of IoT lies for them”.^[190] A company must identify
   where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise
   non-action is the consequence.^[190] This indicates that a major
   roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in
   nature.^[citation needed]

Privacy and security concerns[edit]

   According to a recent study by Noura Aleisa and Karen Renaud at the
   University of Glasgow, "the Internet of things' potential for major
   privacy invasion is a concern"^[191] with much of research
   "disproportionally focused on the security concerns of IoT."^[191]
   Among the "proposed solutions in terms of the techniques they deployed
   and the extent to which they satisfied core privacy principles",^[191]
   only very few turned out to be fully satisfactory. Louis Basenese,
   investment director at Wall Street Daily, has criticized the industry's
   lack of attention to security issues:

     "Despite high-profile and alarming hacks, device manufacturers
     remain undeterred, focusing on profitability over security.
     Consumers need to have ultimate control over collected data,
     including the option to delete it if they choose...Without privacy
     assurances, wide-scale consumer adoption simply won't happen."^[192]

   In a post-Snowden world of global surveillance disclosures, consumers
   take a more active interest in protecting their privacy and demand IoT
   devices to be screened for potential security vulnerabilities and
   privacy violations before purchasing them. According to the 2016
   Accenture Digital Consumer Survey, in which 28000 consumers in 28
   countries were polled on their use of consumer technology, security
   “has moved from being a nagging problem to a top barrier as consumers
   are now choosing to abandon IoT devices and services over security
   concerns.”^[193] The survey revealed that “out of the consumers aware
   of hacker attacks and owning or planning to own IoT devices in the next
   five years, 18 percent decided to terminate the use of the services and
   related services until they get safety guarantees.”^[193] This suggests
   that consumers increasingly perceive privacy risks and security
   concerns to outweigh the value propositions of IoT devices and opt to
   postpone planned purchases or service subscriptions.^[193]

Traditional governance structures[edit]

   A study issued by Ericsson regarding the adoption of Internet of things
   among Danish companies identified a "clash between IoT and companies'
   traditional governance structures, as IoT still presents both
   uncertainties and a lack of historical precedence."^[190] Among the
   respondents interviewed, 60 percent stated that they "do not believe
   they have the organizational capabilities, and three of four do not
   believe they have the processes needed, to capture the IoT
   opportunity."^[190] This has led to a need to understand organizational
   culture in order to facilitate organizational design processes and to
   test new innovation management practices. A lack of digital leadership
   in the age of digital transformation has also stifled innovation and
   IoT adoption to a degree that many companies, in the face of
   uncertainty, "were waiting for the market dynamics to play out",^[190]
   or further action in regards to IoT "was pending competitor moves,
   customer pull, or regulatory requirements."^[190] Some of these
   companies risk being 'kodaked' – "Kodak was a market leader until
   digital disruption eclipsed film photography with digital photos"^[194]
   – failing to "see the disruptive forces affecting their industry"^[195]
   and "to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change
   opens up."^[195] Scott Anthony has written in Harvard Business Review
   that Kodak "created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and
   even understood that photos would be shared online"^[195] but
   ultimately failed to realize that "online photo sharing was the new
   business, not just a way to expand the printing business."^[195]
